## 💡 The Problem
Music is the universal language, but **lyrics often get lost in translation**. 
We listen to K-Pop, Spanish Reggaeton, or Bollywood hits without understanding the soul behind the words. Existing tools are clunky—you have to pause, switch apps, and translate manually. The immersion is broken.

## 🚀 The Solution: LingoLyrics
LingoLyrics bridges the gap between entertainment and education. It's a full-featured music player that syncs lyrics in real-time and provides **instant, magical translations** for any word or sentence you select without ever pausing the music.

### ✨ Key Features (The "Wow" Factor)

*   **🪄 Magic Selection Translation**: Just highlight any lyric—Japanese, Hindi, Spanish—and get an instant, auto-detected translation overlay. It feels like magic.
*   **📚 Smart Vocabulary Deck**: Save interesting words or phrases with one click. Review them later with built-in **AI Pronunciation** to master the accent.
*   **🎤 Real-Time Synced Lyrics**: Karaoke-style scrolling lyrics for millions of songs.
*   **🧠 Intelligent Search**: Powered by a custom algorithm that merges results from multiple APIs (JioSaavn + Invidious) to find *exactly* what you're looking for.
